ftfy is designed to fix problems that were introduced by handling Unicode
incorrectly. It might be able to fix the bytes you just handed it, but the
fact that you just gave a pile of bytes to a function that fixes text means
that your code is *also* handling Unicode incorrectly.

ftfy takes Unicode text as input. You should take these bytes and decode
them from the encoding you think they are in. If you're not sure what encoding
they're in:

- First, try to find out. 'utf-8' is a good assumption.
- If the encoding is simply unknowable, try running your bytes through
  ftfy.guess_bytes. As the name implies, this may not always be accurate.

If you're confused by this, please read the Python Unicode HOWTO:

    http://docs.python.org/3/howto/unicode.html

def fix_encoding(text):
    r"""
    Fix text with incorrectly-decoded garbage ("mojibake") whenever possible.

    This function looks for the evidence of mojibake, formulates a plan to fix
    it, and applies the plan.  It determines whether it should replace nonsense
    sequences of single-byte characters that were really meant to be UTF-8
    characters, and if so, turns them into the correctly-encoded Unicode
    character that they were meant to represent.

    The input to the function must be Unicode. If you don't have Unicode text,
    you're not using the right tool to solve your problem.

    `fix_encoding` decodes text that looks like it was decoded incorrectly. It
    leaves alone text that doesn't.

        >>> fix_encoding('Ãºnico')
        'único'

        >>> fix_encoding('This text is fine already :þ')
        'This text is fine already :þ'

    Because these characters often come from Microsoft products, we allow
    for the possibility that we get not just Unicode characters 128-255, but
    also Windows's conflicting idea of what characters 128-160 are.

        >>> fix_encoding('This â€” should be an em dash')
        'This — should be an em dash'

    We might have to deal with both Windows characters and raw control
    characters at the same time, especially when dealing with characters like
    0x81 that have no mapping in Windows. This is a string that Python's
    standard `.encode` and `.decode` methods cannot correct.

        >>> fix_encoding('This text is sad .â\x81”.')
        'This text is sad .⁔.'

    However, it has safeguards against fixing sequences of letters and
    punctuation that can occur in valid text. In the following example,
    the last three characters are not replaced with a Korean character,
    even though they could be.

        >>> fix_encoding('not such a fan of Charlotte Brontë…”')
        'not such a fan of Charlotte Brontë…”'

    This function can now recover some complex manglings of text, such as when
    UTF-8 mojibake has been normalized in a way that replaces U+A0 with a
    space:

        >>> fix_encoding('The more you know ðŸŒ ')
        'The more you know 🌠'

    Cases of genuine ambiguity can sometimes be addressed by finding other
    characters that are not double-encoded, and expecting the encoding to
    be consistent:

        >>> fix_encoding('AHÅ™, the new sofa from IKEA®')
        'AHÅ™, the new sofa from IKEA®'

    Finally, we handle the case where the text is in a single-byte encoding
    that was intended as Windows-1252 all along but read as Latin-1:

        >>> fix_encoding('This text was never UTF-8 at all\x85')
        'This text was never UTF-8 at all…'

def decode_escapes(text):
    r"""
    Decode backslashed escape sequences, including \\x, \\u, and \\U character
    references, even in the presence of other Unicode.

    This is what Python's "string-escape" and "unicode-escape" codecs were
    meant to do, but in contrast, this actually works. It will decode the
    string exactly the same way that the Python interpreter decodes its string
    literals.

        >>> factoid = '\\u20a1 is the currency symbol for the colón.'
        >>> print(factoid[1:])
        u20a1 is the currency symbol for the colón.
        >>> print(decode_escapes(factoid))
        ₡ is the currency symbol for the colón.

    Even though Python itself can read string literals with a combination of
    escapes and literal Unicode -- you're looking at one right now -- the
    "unicode-escape" codec doesn't work on literal Unicode. (See
    http://stackoverflow.com/a/24519338/773754 for more details.)

    Instead, this function searches for just the parts of a string that
    represent escape sequences, and decodes them, leaving the rest alone. All
    valid escape sequences are made of ASCII characters, and this allows
    "unicode-escape" to work correctly.

    This fix cannot be automatically applied by the `ftfy.fix_text` function,
    because escaped text is not necessarily a mistake, and there is no way
    to distinguish text that's supposed to be escaped from text that isn't.

# This regex implements an exception to restore_byte_a0, so we can decode the

# mode".
#
# If byte C3 appears with a single space after it -- most commonly this shows
# up as " Ã " appearing as an entire word -- we'll insert \xa0 while keeping
# the space. Without this change, we would decode "à" as the start of the next
# word, such as "àla". It's almost always intended to be a separate word, as in
# "à la", but when mojibake turns this into "Ã\xa0 la", the two kinds of spaces
# get coalesced into "Ã la".
#
# We make exceptions for the Portuguese words "às", "àquele", "àquela",
# "àquilo" and their plurals -- these are contractions of, for example, "a
# aquele" and are very common. Note that the final letter is important to
# distinguish this case from French "à quel point".
#
# Other instances in Portuguese, such as "àfrica", seem to be typos (intended
# to be "África" with the accent in the other direction).
#
# Unfortunately, "à" is a common letter in Catalan, and mojibake of words that
# contain it will end up with inserted spaces. We can't do the right thing with
# every word. The cost is that the mojibake text "fÃ cil" will be interpreted as
# "fà cil", not "fàcil".

def replace_lossy_sequences(byts):
    """
    This function identifies sequences where information has been lost in
    a "sloppy" codec, indicated by byte 1A, and if they would otherwise look
    like a UTF-8 sequence, it replaces them with the UTF-8 sequence for U+FFFD.

    A further explanation:

    ftfy can now fix text in a few cases that it would previously fix
    incompletely, because of the fact that it can't successfully apply the fix
    to the entire string. A very common case of this is when characters have
    been erroneously decoded as windows-1252, but instead of the "sloppy"
    windows-1252 that passes through unassigned bytes, the unassigned bytes get
    turned into U+FFFD (�), so we can't tell what they were.

    This most commonly happens with curly quotation marks that appear
    ``â€œ like this â€�``.

    We can do better by building on ftfy's "sloppy codecs" to let them handle
    less-sloppy but more-lossy text. When they encounter the character ``�``,
    instead of refusing to encode it, they encode it as byte 1A -- an
    ASCII control code called SUBSTITUTE that once was meant for about the same
    purpose. We can then apply a fixer that looks for UTF-8 sequences where
    some continuation bytes have been replaced by byte 1A, and decode the whole
    sequence as �; if that doesn't work, it'll just turn the byte back into �
    itself.

    As a result, the above text ``â€œ like this â€�`` will decode as
    ``“ like this �``.

    If U+1A was actually in the original string, then the sloppy codecs will
    not be used, and this function will not be run, so your weird control
    character will be left alone but wacky fixes like this won't be possible.
