    Given Unicode text as input, fix inconsistencies and glitches in it,
    such as mojibake.

    Let's start with some examples:

        >>> print(fix_text('uÌˆnicode'))
        ünicode

        >>> print(fix_text('Broken text&hellip; it&#x2019;s ﬂubberiﬁc!',
        ...                normalization='NFKC'))
        Broken text... it's flubberific!

        >>> print(fix_text('HTML entities &lt;3'))
        HTML entities <3

        >>> print(fix_text('<em>HTML entities &lt;3</em>'))
        <em>HTML entities &lt;3</em>

        >>> print(fix_text("&macr;\\_(ã\x83\x84)_/&macr;"))
        ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

        >>> # This example string starts with a byte-order mark, even if
        >>> # you can't see it on the Web.
        >>> print(fix_text('\ufeffParty like\nit&rsquo;s 1999!'))
        Party like
        it's 1999!

        >>> print(fix_text('ＬＯＵＤ　ＮＯＩＳＥＳ'))
        LOUD NOISES

        >>> len(fix_text('ﬁ' * 100000))
        200000

        >>> len(fix_text(''))
        0

    Based on the options you provide, ftfy applies these steps in order:

    - If `remove_terminal_escapes` is True, remove sequences of bytes that are
      instructions for Unix terminals, such as the codes that make text appear
      in different colors.

    - If `fix_encoding` is True, look for common mistakes that come from
      encoding or decoding Unicode text incorrectly, and fix them if they are
      reasonably fixable. See `fixes.fix_encoding` for details.

    - If `fix_entities` is True, replace HTML entities with their equivalent
      characters. If it's "auto" (the default), then consider replacing HTML
      entities, but don't do so in text where you have seen a pair of actual
      angle brackets (that's probably actually HTML and you shouldn't mess
      with the entities).

    - If `uncurl_quotes` is True, replace various curly quotation marks with
      plain-ASCII straight quotes.

    - If `fix_latin_ligatures` is True, then ligatures made of Latin letters,
      such as `ﬁ`, will be separated into individual letters. These ligatures
      are usually not meaningful outside of font rendering, and often represent
      copy-and-paste errors.

    - If `fix_character_width` is True, half-width and full-width characters
      will be replaced by their standard-width form.

    - If `fix_line_breaks` is true, convert all line breaks to Unix style
      (CRLF and CR line breaks become LF line breaks).

    - If `fix_surrogates` is true, ensure that there are no UTF-16 surrogates
      in the resulting string, by converting them to the correct characters
      when they're appropriately paired, or replacing them with \ufffd
      otherwise.

    - If `remove_control_chars` is true, remove control characters that
      are not suitable for use in text. This includes most of the ASCII control
      characters, plus some Unicode controls such as the byte order mark
      (U+FEFF). Useful control characters, such as Tab, Line Feed, and
      bidirectional marks, are left as they are.

    - If `remove_bom` is True, remove the Byte-Order Mark at the start of the
      string if it exists. (This is largely redundant, because it's a special
      case of `remove_control_characters`. This option will become deprecated
      in a later version.)

    - If `normalization` is not None, apply the specified form of Unicode
      normalization, which can be one of 'NFC', 'NFKC', 'NFD', and 'NFKD'.

      - The default normalization, NFC, combines characters and diacritics that
        are written using separate code points, such as converting "e" plus an
        acute accent modifier into "é", or converting "ka" (か) plus a dakuten
        into the single character "ga" (が). Unicode can be converted to NFC
        form without any change in its meaning.

      - If you ask for NFKC normalization, it will apply additional
        normalizations that can change the meanings of characters. For example,
        ellipsis characters will be replaced with three periods, all ligatures
        will be replaced with the individual characters that make them up,
        and characters that differ in font style will be converted to the same
        character.

    - If anything was changed, repeat all the steps, so that the function is
      idempotent. "&amp;amp;" will become "&", for example, not "&amp;".

    `fix_text` will work one line at a time, with the possibility that some
    lines are in different encodings, allowing it to fix text that has been
    concatenated together from different sources.

    When it encounters lines longer than `max_decode_length` (1 million
    codepoints by default), it will not run the `fix_encoding` step, to avoid
    unbounded slowdowns.

    If you're certain that any decoding errors in the text would have affected
    the entire text in the same way, and you don't mind operations that scale
    with the length of the text, you can use `fix_text_segment` directly to
    fix the whole string in one batch.

    NOTE: Using `guess_bytes` is not the recommended way of using ftfy. ftfy
    is not designed to be an encoding detector.

    In the unfortunate situation that you have some bytes in an unknown
    encoding, ftfy can guess a reasonable strategy for decoding them, by trying
    a few common encodings that can be distinguished from each other.

    Unlike the rest of ftfy, this may not be accurate, and it may *create*
    Unicode problems instead of solving them!

    It doesn't try East Asian encodings at all, and if you have East Asian text
    that you don't know how to decode, you are somewhat out of luck.  East
    Asian encodings require some serious statistics to distinguish from each
    other, so we can't support them without decreasing the accuracy of ftfy.

    If you don't know which encoding you have at all, I recommend
    trying the 'chardet' module, and being appropriately skeptical about its
    results.

    The encodings we try here are:

    - UTF-16 with a byte order mark, because a UTF-16 byte order mark looks
      like nothing else
    - UTF-8, because it's the global standard, which has been used by a
      majority of the Web since 2008
    - "utf-8-variants", because it's what people actually implement when they
      think they're doing UTF-8
    - MacRoman, because Microsoft Office thinks it's still a thing, and it
      can be distinguished by its line breaks. (If there are no line breaks in
      the string, though, you're out of luck.)
