    The keys are of the same types as the input: if a speaker_id was
    passed in, the corresponding key will be a speaker_id, etc. For pairwise
    scores, the keys are tuples (speaker, target).

    There are also helper functions for filtering scores or getting aggregate
    scores (though these can be more conveniently accessed through
    Coordination's `summarize()` method, using the `summary_report=True`
    option).
